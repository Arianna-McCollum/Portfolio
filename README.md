# Portfolio

The goal of this project was to jump start my future portfolio as a developer. I've created a simple portfolio that is responsive and will be an excellent starting point of something that will most certainly improve in the future.

The porfolio has a fixed header as you scroll down the page and is responsive to different screen sizes when applied. My goal was to create something simple and functional.
